- **Dynamic Technical Assessment**: Generates relevant technical questions based on candidate's tech stack
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Maintains conversation flow and handles follow-up questions
- **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit interface with real-time progress tracking
- **Privacy Compliant**: Handles candidate data securely with simulated/anonymized processing
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust handling of unexpected inputs and graceful conversation endings

## üöÄ Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Project**

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Create .env file for OpenAI API (optional - app works without it)
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The application will automatically open in your default browser

## üìñ Usage Guide

### For Candidates

1. **Start Conversation**: The chatbot greets you and explains its purpose
2. **Provide Basic Information**: Share your name, contact details, experience, and desired positions
3. **Declare Tech Stack**: List your technical skills, programming languages, frameworks, and tools
4. **Answer Technical Questions**: Respond to tailored questions based on your expertise
5. **Conclusion**: Receive information about next steps in the hiring process

### Navigation Tips

- **Sidebar Progress**: Track your screening progress in real-time
- **Conversation History**: Review all previous exchanges
- **Reset Session**: Start over anytime with the "Start New Session" button
- **End Conversation**: Type keywords like "goodbye", "exit", or "quit" to conclude

## üõ† Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for interactive web interface
- **Backend**: Python with object-oriented design
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo with intelligent fallback system
- **Data Management**: In-memory session state with structured data classes
- **Conversation Flow**: State machine pattern for stage management

### Libraries Used

- `streamlit==1.28.1`: Web application framework
- `openai==1.3.7`: AI language model integration
- `python-dotenv==1.0.0`: Environment variable management
- `pandas==2.1.3`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy==1.24.3`: Numerical computing support
- `requests==2.31.0`: HTTP library for API calls

### Key Components

1. **CandidateInfo**: Data class for structured candidate information storage
2. **HiringAssistant**: Main AI assistant class with conversation management
3. **Conversation Stages**: Structured flow through greeting, info gathering, tech assessment, and conclusion
4. **Technical Question Database**: Curated questions for various technologies
5. **Information Extraction**: Regex-based parsing for automatic data collection

## üé® Prompt Design Strategy

### System Prompt Architecture

The application uses dynamic system prompts that adapt based on conversation stage:

1. **Stage-Specific Prompts**: Each conversation stage has tailored instructions
2. **Context Injection**: Candidate information is dynamically included in prompts
3. **Behavioral Guidelines**: Consistent rules for professional, focused interactions
4. **Fallback Logic**: Rule-based responses when AI API is unavailable

### Prompt Engineering Principles

- **Clarity**: Clear, specific instructions for each conversation stage
- **Consistency**: Maintained professional tone and focus throughout
- **Adaptability**: Dynamic content based on candidate responses
- **Robustness**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs and edge cases

### Technical Question Generation

- **Tech Stack Mapping**: Intelligent matching of candidate skills to question database
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Questions appropriate for declared experience level
- **Variety**: Multiple question types per technology
- **Relevance**: Industry-standard questions for practical assessment

## üîß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Context Management
**Problem**: Maintaining conversation context across multiple exchanges
**Solution**: Implemented state machine with structured data classes and session management

### Challenge 2: Information Extraction
**Problem**: Parsing unstructured candidate responses for structured data
**Solution**: Regex patterns and heuristic matching for common information formats

### Challenge 3: Technical Question Relevance
**Problem**: Generating appropriate questions for diverse tech stacks
**Solution**: Curated question database with intelligent technology matching

### Challenge 4: Graceful Degradation
**Problem**: Handling API failures and unexpected inputs
**Solution**: Comprehensive fallback system with rule-based responses

### Challenge 5: User Experience
**Problem**: Creating intuitive interface for non-technical users
**Solution**: Clean Streamlit UI with progress tracking and clear instructions

## üîí Data Privacy & Security
