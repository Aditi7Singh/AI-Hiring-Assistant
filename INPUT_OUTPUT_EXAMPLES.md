## üíª Stage 3: Tech Stack Declaration

### **Input:** `"Python, JavaScript, React, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Git"`
**Expected Output:**
```
Excellent, John Smith! Based on your tech stack, I have some technical questions for you:

1. **Python**: Explain the difference between list and tuple in Python.

2. **Python**: What is a decorator in Python and how would you implement one?

3. **JavaScript**: What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?

4. **JavaScript**: Explain closures in JavaScript with an example.

5. **React**: What is the virtual DOM and how does it work?

Please answer these questions to demonstrate your technical knowledge.
```

---

## üéØ Stage 4: Technical Questions & Responses

### **Input:** 
```
"1. Lists are mutable and can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable. Lists use square brackets [], tuples use parentheses ().

2. A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. Example:
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function")
        func()
        print("After function")
    return wrapper

3. var has function scope, let and const have block scope. const cannot be reassigned after declaration.

4. A closure is when an inner function has access to variables from its outer function even after the outer function has returned.

5. Virtual DOM is a JavaScript representation of the real DOM. React uses it to efficiently update the UI by comparing changes and updating only what's necessary."
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Excellent technical responses, John Smith! Your answers demonstrate strong understanding of:

‚úÖ Python data structures and advanced concepts
‚úÖ JavaScript fundamentals and ES6 features  
‚úÖ React architecture and performance optimization

Based on your responses, you show solid proficiency across your declared tech stack. Your explanations are clear and demonstrate practical understanding.

Is there anything else you'd like to add about your technical experience or any questions you have about the role?
```
